**Portfolio with SQLALchemy**

This project is a portfolio application built using Flask and SQLAlchemy. 

To run the app locally head to the project directory:
1. run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. run 'python app.py'
3. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000 (check the console logs for the exact address as it could be different)
4. Enjoy the app!



What I have learned:



Flask-SQLAlchemy Model and Database Connection
Create a model class for adding and editing project information. Connect to the database.

NOTE: When run, the database should already contain at least the 4 previous projects of the Techdegree.

Routes for the Application
Create each of the following routes for your application

What I can improve: Buttons, for the love of god buttons and CSS. I think I did 90% of the actual work in about 2.5 hours and spent the rest of the time trying to fix the damn buttons and css styling. I rewrote this sentence 3 times with expletives but I removed them incase you were to fail me on it.
